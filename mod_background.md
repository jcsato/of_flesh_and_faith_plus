# Mod Background and Design Goals

I've intended for some time to write detailed design and lore docs for each of the origins in this mod. That effort has proven exceedingly involved for a variety of reasons, so this is not that.

Still, I felt it would be valuable to provide at least _some_ detail around why I made this mod and my goals for it, so here's my attempt at a primer.

### Why does OFF+ exist?

When Overhype and I were developing Of Flesh and Faith, I wanted to give a sort of "thank you" to players who had bought the previous DLC in the form of new origins. My thinking was that this would increase the value add of OFF, maybe make the other DLC a bit more attractive to those who were on the fence, and most importantly allow for use of mechanics and content added in those DLC (for example, the existence of champions, which depends on Warriors of the North).

Overhype (wisely, in retrospect) chose not to pursue this idea of mine very far, but at that point I'd already designed the basic form of the origins. I felt confident that they were a positive value add to the game and so worked on them separately from the DLC - that formed the basis of this mod.

Additionally, during development and playtesting, there were a host of changes and concessions that needed to be made for the Oathtaker and Anatomist origins. Many of these were net positive, but others were simply compromises we had to make for production reasons. While working on the other origins, I decided to save some of these "cutting room floor" concepts and ideas.

I dubbed this collection of changes "Of Flesh and Faith+" - not a "version 2" or a replacement, but a sort of content expansion and refinement of the DLC.

### Leading Design Principle

I've found that for many veteran players, Battle Brothers has become something of a rote experience. They try the same snowball tactics, make the same builds, and pursue much the same challenges from campaign to campaign. This is "fine", but I think there's value in trying to push players out of their comfort zones and encourage them to try new things or pursue different objectives.

With that in mind, my goal with all of these origins is to **change how players approach their campaigns.**

In practice, this has mostly manifested as "change how players approach building their bros", which I am content with as the heart of any bbros campaign is, of course, the titular battle brothers.

### The Cursed Explorers

I've always been interested in the design space of "strong units that get weaker over time". Many games that explore this do so in a way that simply compels players to not use these strong units at all (the starting paladin in mid-series Fire Emblem games, for example). I find it much more interesting to strongly encourage _use_ of these depreciating assets, as I think it makes for compelling tactical and (especially) strategic decisions.

Additionally, I've found that for all the content added to the game world and all the forays into enabling long trips like Cured Rations and the Scavenger, "exploration" as a goal is not particularly well rewarded by the vanilla bbros gameplay loop. Beasts & Exploration already has its first concept explored by the Beast Slayer origin, so I wanted to take a crack at the second.

### The Rune Chosen

The Rune Chosen are actually a rehash of my original pitch for the Anatomists. They were originally going to be a band of barber-surgeons, half-Dr. Frankenstein and half-Andreas Vesalius. They would dissect their fallen comrades to try to discover what made them good or bad warriors.

While the Rune Chosen totally changed (and, in my view, improved) the origin's flavor, the fundamentals behind the gameplay mechanics remain. The goal here is, of course, to help ease less confident players into ironman campaigns. By turning losses into gains, players are encouraged to "roll with the punches". It also makes said gains much easier to design. A powerful, impactful buff that's interesting and fun to use is a lot easier to work into the game's balance when you had to lose a powerful unit to get it.

Gating rune acquisition (and the power of that rune) by level was also done to discourage farming. The "point" of the origin is more to make deaths meaningful and encourage players not to savescum, and _not_ to make it a power trip collect-a-thon with more steps. As such, it couldn't incentivize players to just hire a bunch of cheap peasants and suicide them to farm runes.

### The Southern Assassins

The overarching goal with the Assassins is to introduce "reactivity" into bro builds. The poisons, specialties, and philosophies can work with many builds, but often they don't align well with the "default" build players would pick for a given bro. Reducing the total number of perks acquirable balances the power bump from these additional effects, but it also forces players to critically examine how to best pivot/salvage/capitalize on a bro's build.

I've gotten some feedback that the Assassin abilities are not powerful enough to compensate for "losing" a perk, but I think this misses the point. You cannot switch origins once you've started a campaign, so those perks weren't "lost" - they were, in fact, not there from the start.

As for ordering, poisons are the first unlock because they often have the biggest effect on what weapon a bro should wield. This can be the most important choice for a build so it needs come early and players need space to react and plan accordingly. The specialties *can* impact weapon choice, so they push off picking a mastery by another level. In practice most players don't actually take weapon mastery perks until late in the build anyway, so this doesn't do a ton to interfere with a bro's overall power progression. Philosophies need to come at level 8 because Nimble & Battleforged are too important and forcing players to get another level before picking them is extremely impactful. The philosophies themselves are less build defining and more just offer conditional power on top of what's already there. Players have a couple perk choices after to swerve if they need to, though.

### The Oathtakers

The OFF+ Oathtakers aren't there to "fix" anything, per se, but the vanilla implementation of the origin makes for an extremely limiting design space. I'll try to hit the biggest points and leave it at those for now.

Many players bemoan the origin's loss of Ambitions because it prevents them from getting the Orc & Goblin trophies, but I think the narrative impact of their absence is often undersold. The conceit of Battle Brothers, regardless of origin, is that of running a medieval mercenary company. The "story" of the game is one of how the company forms, how it recruited its most famous men and earned its trophies and won its finest victories and suffered its worst losses. Most of this is player driven and given extra flavor by the event system, but the only structure providing the "plot beats" of this narrative are the Ambitions. Commissioning a banner, naming a sergeant, gaining fame and trophies - these are the points on the arc of the company's character. Without them, the Oathtakers are left in a sort of limbo. Even the Davkul Cultists form into a proper mercenary company (at least on the surface), yet the Oathtakers just sort of. . .exist. Oathing around, as it were.

Shifting the oaths to be individual and chosen by the player makes them proactive rather than reactive. It might seem strange to frame this shift as a positive in light of the assassins above, but the issue is that it's rather difficult to react to the oaths in vanilla. Being temporary means that often the default reaction is to "survive" an oath rather than to lean into it. There are concessions to the OFF+ approach with the Book of Oaths, but giving the oaths permanence and allowing players more agency in their completion makes the mechanic much more engaging. Additionally, making the oaths individual rather company-wide allows for a greater variety of debuffs, as there's a smaller blast radius and less risk of crippling unintended builds with them.

The choice of what oaths to have a bro pursue should be meaningful, but not paralyzing. Limiting the total completable to three oaths each gives some room to explore but also puts an upper limit on their power add. Additionally, the cap also puts a practical soft limit on the number of oaths that players need to manage at once, which can be pretty important when you've got 15-20 bros in the company.
