## Features

Of Flesh and Faith+ is a content expansion to the Of Flesh and Faith DLC. It adds three new origins, one for each of the previous major Battle Brothers DLC, as well as mechanical and content additions to the two new DLC origins, the Oathtakers and the Anatomists.

### **The Cursed Explorers (Beasts & Exploration)**

The Cursed Explorers are a group of adventurers, vagabonds, and castaways brought together by a common foe: the Pillager Rot, a degenerative disease that eats away at the body and dulls the senses. Having exhausted mundane cures, they now turn to myth and legend to rid themselves of the plague. Can they find the Fountain of Youth before it's too late?

A driven group, the Cursed Explorers gain permanent statboosts every time they explore a legendary location, confident that every myth they prove true simply affirms the existence of the fountain. Additionally, being explorers, they gradually accrue expertise as they map out the land, gaining experience each time the company discovers a new location.

These boosts are needed, however, as the dreaded Pillager Rot dogs the company's heels. Over time, your men suffer progressively more manifestations of the illness as it slowly robs them of their physical health and combat prowess. And think twice before replacing your sickly veterans - many are willing to risk contracting the Rot in return for the excitement of mercenary life, but expect to have to pay extra to hire new recruits!

### **Old Ironhand's Rune Chosen (Warriors of the North)**

<img src="./readme_assets/RuneChosen.png" width="1200">

Followers of an esoteric god, the Rune Chosen are a cult of barbarian warriors who seek only a glorious death in battle. When one who has proven himself worthy falls, it is the duty of his comrades to take on the strength of his soul and seek victory for them both.

Whenever a member of the Rune Chosen falls in battle, his soul is immortalized in a carved rune - provided he was of high enough level to warrant such a rite. Depending on how powerful a warrior he was, his soul is shaped into an accordingly powerful rune. These runes may be given to another member of the company, who will carry that boon permanently.

Do not think to cheat death under Old Ironhand's auspices, however - any Rune Chosen that falls in battle will be dead forever, with no chance of merely being struck down with an injury.

### **The Southern Assassins (Blazing Deserts)**

<img src="./readme_assets/SouthernAssassins.png" width="1200">

The Southern Assassins are an esoteric group, part cold-blooded killer, part Crownling. Seeking out a heretic too powerful for the guilds to touch, they take on contracts as any other sellsword might - but their past is never far behind.

At levels 3, 6, and 9, each member of the company gains a random assassin speciality instead of a perk point. These can range from powerful poisons that are inflicted with every blow to combat specialties to whole schools of thought that change how an individual assassin approaches the battlefield.

Providing this training to mercenaries of less exotic backgrounds are two master assassins. They permanently occupy two slots of the company retinue from the outset, limiting options for other camp followers.

### **The Oathtakers**

The Oathtakers origin has had its mechanics expanded, with an additional Oath and a new mechanic to incentivize completing their special Oath bonus objectives.

The **Oath of Proving** sees the company commit to martial excellence on an individual level. Every man in the company gets a bonus in combat until he fells his first enemy - but any who fails to kill a foe by the end of the fight will no longer gain any experience whatsoever until he redeems himself in the future.

Additionally, fulfilling the special objective of any Oath grants a **unique-per-Oath trait** to all men currently in the company, immortalizing some of the lessons learned while undertaking it.

Lastly, the **Oath of Camaraderie** has been reworked with a new effect and, along with the **Oath of Fortification**, a new bonus objective. The **Oath of Distinction** has had its XP mechanics tweaked under the hood to hopefully better match player expectations.

### **The Anatomists**

The Anatomists have gotten a small update as well, with a new potion added for the Conquerer. You'll have to seek out the Monolith and defeat him for yourself to see what it does!

A best-effort attempt will be made to note any save-game incompatible updates to the mod on the releases page.
