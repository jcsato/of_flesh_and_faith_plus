# Mechanics, Abilities, and Effects (SPOIILERS)

While a large part of the vanilla bbros experience is discovery and OFF+ maintains that, a number of people have asked for clarity around the various origin mechanics introduced in the mod, as well as a full list of effects. This is that list.

It can be difficult to evaluate balance in a vacuum. Use this as a reference, and not a source, when comparing different effects.

Consider everything in here to be **SPOILERS**.

## The Cursed Explorers

**Volition of the Cursed**

<details>

+1 Resolve, Melee Skill, Ranged Skill, Melee Defense, and Ranged Defense per Legendary Location cleared ("cleared" means won the battle, if there's a battle associated with the location - otherwise you just need to complete the event).

Gained automatically when either of the above effects apply.

</details>

### The Rots

<details>

## The Oathtakers

### Oaths

Bros can be committed to unlocked oaths via the Book of Oaths. The player starts with the Oaths of Tithing and Loyalty, and unlocks more as their bros complete oaths. Oaths are completed by fulfilling certain conditions unique to the oath taken (e.g. "take part in 5 consecutive, victorious battles") and confirming via the Book of Oaths.

There are five unlocks, which are granted via a special event that also gives an Oathtaker (with scaled gear), if the player chooses to take him on to the company.
